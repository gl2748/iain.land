        ## Comedian.  

        Turns out there're a few things you ought not to  
        publicly disparage.  

        Like the TSA,  
        or other people’s choices.  

        Turns out that  
        sometimes you think  
        you are alone  
        but you are not.  

        like when you’re talking to your dog  
        or riding the bus.
