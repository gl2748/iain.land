      # FACEBOOK AS A TRANSITIONAL OBJECT.

      ## TL;DR

      Facebook is like a transitional object. It is something we hold onto in times of anxiety. It gives us comfort because we never ask ‘is this part of me, or something external to me’. Because we never question it in this way it affords us a space where we have the illusion that the outer world accords with our inner life. This gives us a magical feeling akin to omnipotence, this feeling is important to us and this leads us to share these illusory experiences with others. Eventually, we form groups around our shared illusory experiences. Sometimes this leads to mass movements and significant changes in the way we all live. However Facebook is an imperfect transitional object because it never wants us to let go. Oculus is totalising in scope and it is like the technology consumes us.

      ## PART I

      The idea of the transitional object comes from Donald Winnicott. Winnicott was the first pediatrician in the United Kingdom to be trained as a psychoanalyst. His focus was developmental theories; what a person’s earliest experiences, with their ‘mother’ or any good enough caregiver, mean.

      > “At the start is an essential aloneness. At the same time this aloneness can only take place under  maximum conditions of dependency.”

      Winnicott was preoccupied with how we transition from this initial state of dependency to one where we are individuals in the world. Importantly, Winnicott conceptualized our utmost aloneness and dependence as infants as putting us in communication with some notion of the infinite — namely omnipotence.

      For example at the beginning our ‘mother’ is perfectly adapted to our needs. We are presented with a breast at the moment we conceive of hunger; it is like we created the breast from which we feed. This metaphor where the breast satisfies a nascent hunger extends to any want or need satisfied by the ever-attendant care-givers. The cumulative effect of this attention, at the beginning at least, is that we are in some way deluded into believing that we control the world around us and that what we create in our minds really comes to exist.

      This illusion of omnipotence is slowly eroded as our parents become less adapted to our every whim. Gradually we get used to longer periods of frustration. We learn that a process exists and sometimes waiting is enough. Later on we are weaned, and encouraged to explore where we end and where the world begins. Eventually, we find ourselves able —  by remembering, reliving, fantasizing and dreaming —  to live in a resistant world where accord between our inner life and the outside world is the exception rather than the rule. Transitional objects, as their name suggests, help us make this transition.

      Winnicott gives as examples of transitional objects: the frayed corner of a sheet or blanket or a favorite soft toy like a teddy bear. Winnicott extends these objects to phenomena and includes particular  pieces of music, comforting mannerisms or behavior patterns that can help comfort  babies at times of loneliness or anxiety. That said, when trying to understand transitional objects, what they are exactly is less important than their role and how an infant relates to them.

      A transitional object’s role is as a hopeful reminder throughout innumerable vicissitudes of our original state. One in which we had the magical feeling that we had the control to make things in the real world match our inner ideas. Crucial for the survival of these transitional phenomena is that they persist in a way that means we never address their outer character. For example parents learn about the extra-ordinariness of transitional objects, going so far as to avoid washing them and never fundamentally altering them in case they lose their special characteristics. Because they remain unchallenged and unchanged transitional phenomena are thereby exempted by the demands made by everything else that we ‘grow up’.

      > “Of the transitional object it can be said that it is a matter of agreement between us and the baby that we will never ask the question ‘Did you conceive of this or was it presented to you from without?’ The important point is that no decision on this point is expected. The question is not to be formulated.”

      How the infant relates to a transitional object incorporates this unquestioned aspect. It is not a hallucination, nor is it  something belonging to the external world, rather for the infant the transitional phenomena exists in an intermediate state. The transitional object spans the infant’s internal and external world, without seeming to belong to either, or without its belonging ever needing definition. Winnicott defines how the infant relates to a transitional object in the following way:

      > 1. The infant assumes rights over the object, and agree to this assumption.Nevertheless some abrogation of omnipotence is a feature from the start.
      2. The object is affectionately cuddled as well as excitedly loved and mutilated.
      3. It must never change, unless changed by the infant.
      4. It must survive instinctual loving, and also hating, and, if it be a feature, pure aggression.
      5. Yet it must seem to the infant to give warmth, or to move, or to have texture, or to do something that seems to show it has vitality or reality of its own.
      6. It comes from without from our point of view, but not so from the point of view of the baby. Neither does it come from within; it is not an hallucination.
      7. Its fate is to be gradually decathected, so that in the course of years it becomes not so much forgotten as relegated to limbo. By this I mean that in health the transitional object does not ‘go inside’ nor does the feeling about it necessarily undergo repression. It is not forgotten and it is not mourned. It loses meaning, and this is because the transitional phenomena have become diffused, have become spread out over the whole intermediate territory between ‘inner psychic reality’ and ‘the external world as perceived by two persons in common’, that is to say, over the whole cultural field.

      > “At this point my subject widens out into that of play, and of artistic creativity and appreciation, and of religious feeling, and of dreaming, and also of fetishism, lying and stealing, the origin and loss of affectionate feeling, drug addiction, the talisman of obsessional rituals, etc.”

      Finally, then we reach a point where the transitional object dissolves and its key usefulness comes into focus. It initiates a continuum of meaning between ourselves and the world around us and this continuum is at the core of what makes life in a world of frustrations, disappointments and struggles, worth living. The value of this continuum / conenction can be illustrated by its negative, what happens when it is broken:


      > “A relationship to external reality which is one of compliance, the world and its details being recognised but only as something to be fitted in with or demanding adaptation. Compliance carries with it a sense of futility for the individual and is associated with the idea that nothing matters.”


      ## PART II

      It is not so hard to extend the idea to Facebook.  Much like a Transitional Object it is subject to our control but also resistant to it. Our daily updates and customizations are much like acts of love, deletions and trimming motivated by a feeling almost like hate all of which the Profile survives. Sometimes it even offers up just the right amount of resistance to give the impression it has a life outside of us. Other users add content, while Facebook’s appearance  slowly, almost imperceptibly evolves. In fact,  just like a Transitional Object we never ask of  it; ‘is this  part of me or external to me?’. Our profile pages, timelines, and the News Feed - feel like something created by us and simultaneously provided by the environment. Facebook’s algorithms are 100% adapted to our wants and needs. They diligently monitor our behaviour, processing thosands of signals so that they can present us with what we want at just the right moment. Facebook is therefore much like a Transitional Object, an intermediate  space where we can re-discover the illusion of accord between our inner lives and the external world,  it gives us an illusion of creativity and control.

      > “I am here staking a claim for an intermediate state between a baby’s inability and growing ability to recognize and accept reality. I am therefore studying the substance of illusion, that which is allowed to the infant, and which in adult life is inherent in art and religion. We can share a respect for illusory experience, and if we wish we may collect together and form a group on the basis of the similarity of our illusory experiences. This is a natural root of grouping among human beings.”
